Static surveying
================

Use these scripts to get started or perform static geodetic surveys using `RINEX-Cli` and 
the `-c` option of the `-p` opmode.

Static geodetic surveying aims at solving the coordinates of a future Reference Station,
without apriori knowledge and with high precision as possible.

These scripts use high interpolation orders, which is compatible with long periods of signal observations.  
Reduce those when working with shorter observation periods.
